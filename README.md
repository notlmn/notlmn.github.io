Okay, if you are here then you have seen my work somewhere, in my repos or my contributions to someone else's repos (or to your's, yes _your_ repos).

Yup, that's what I am, an open-source contributor, tech enthusiast, and occasional speaker.

I talk to people, help them learn new technologies, and learn some new things along the way.

Take a look at some of my source repos [here](https://github.com/notlmn?tab=repositories&type=source), and on the organization [@ramlmn](https://github.com/ramlmn).

Reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bytemode), or email.
